* Login Jenkins with admin user, go to `Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security`, select `Jenkinsâ€™ own user database` under `Security Realm`, and select `Matrix-based security` under `Authorization` (the default choice is `Logged-in users can do anything`)

* Add `admin` into `User/group`, and select all the privileges so `admin` can do anything
